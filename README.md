## Event Tracker
#### Erin Eustice

#### Overview
In this project I created a RESTful API that provides the ability to perform full CRUD on an event entity. I chose to create an application that can track all of the books you have read.
This weekend I built out the front end for my application using Javascript.
* Implements full CRUD
* added scripts to application
* ability to send Asynchronous requests to Java controllers with JavaScripts XMLHttpRequest
* ability to consume and parse JSON responses with JavaScript

* All interactions with database are done so RESTfully
